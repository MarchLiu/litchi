    "As told by the prophets of Kin and of the prophets of Shey, yea the speakers for the Sisters of life-light.\n",
    "To all the inhabitants of those under the suns, hear the words and hearken.\n",
    "Before the birth of Kin and Shey, there was the calm, and of the calm stood in the midst the settled rock, and the settled rock were as of many rocks each holding fast to its own place.\n",
    "And the settled rock held firm for many eternal lapses, yea those motionless giants lay dormant with no power nor means to shake them from their posts.\n",
    "And it came to pass that the Nameless Mother declared, for behold it shall be the first and last of her presence known unto us, and we are most pleased in her words for they are life and they are light unto all the people under the suns, yea and unto the people under all the suns\n",
    "That her mercy has been bestowed upon us, O us wretched and named souls as we are, to give unto us her word and her word was all to give unto us.\n",
    "And thus the Nameless Mother declared, “I shall touch the settled rock and shall make life and shall make light unto all there shall be.”\n",
    "And it came to pass that the Nameless Mother touched the settled rock and made life and made light and made Kin and made Shey, in the burst of that life-light.\n",
    "And the life and the light of Kin and Shey cracked the settled rock, or a rock settled in the midst thereof, whilst magic was strewn there from.\n",
    "And the magic filled the calm, yea the weave of magic flowed between the settled rock and shuddered the rocks.\n",
    "Now behold, the rock that was touched was ill-tempered by the touch, and the rock was called Gyvth for his temper was terrible because of his waking.\n",
    "Thus Gyvth from his beginning was always angered and was always impatient towards the Nameless Mother and her mercies to us inhabitants under the suns.\n",
    "So Gyvth was forthwith cursed, for our sakes.\n",
    "And Gyvth was even more angered because of his curse, and there arose great tempests and whirlwinds from his heart.\n",
    "And all the inhabitants thereon, looked and beheld the tempests and trembled in fear of his anger, and gave sacrifice and pleadings unto Gyvth, praying unto him for their salvation from his temper.\n",
    "And Gyvth was appeased by their offerings and laid at rest his temper for a season.\n",
    "For behold, in his remembrance of the temper he has incurred, he rises the tempests again from his heart each timespan.\n",
    "And behold, the inhabitants thereon shall again offer sacrifice and pleadings and prayers unto him to appease his anger, less the whole earth be smitten with the tempests of his heart.\n",
    "And the tempests which first shook the whole of Gyvth we know not of, save that they were terrible and great and the inhabitants thereon trembled in fear of his anger and appeased their god.\n",
    "Chapter 2\n",
    "Hear ye the words of the prophets, for they speak the desires of Kin and Shey, who desire to have us inhabitants under the life-light be knowledgeable of all things under the suns, yea even of Kin and Shey.\n",
    "And the words which were given unto the prophets shall not be forgotten so they shall be thus written for the benefit of the inhabitants.\n",
    "For it is by the grace of Kin and Shey that we are and were and will be, and that we were to be given unto that Gyvth who was touched in the awakening.\n",
    "And it came to pass that Kin and Shey looked and beheld the shuddering of the settled rock and were pleased, saying, “it is well for the rocks to shudder so that the magic may be weaved therein and the inhabitants may be placed thereon.”\n",
    "And it came to pass that Shey spoke to Kin, saying, “Kin, upon these rocks shalt thou makest life that the magic may be given purpose, less the shuddering is in vain.”\n",
    "And Kin cast forth her life-light and upon the rocks created life that the magic may have habitation.\n",
    "And the life-light struck the settled rock and fragments formed asundered.\n",
    "And the fragments fell each to its place, that is the place of rock among the settled rocks, and the fragments breathed in new life.\n",
    "And the fragments took shape, and grew legs, and walked upon its place.\n",
    "And it came to pass that Shey spoke to Kin, saying, “Kin, we shall call the life colossal, for they which proceed them shall be small and shalt see them as colossal.  We have formed colossals to walk upon their place to prepare the place before them.”\n",
    "[“before them” being interpreted as before the humans]\n",
    "And it came to pass that Kin spoke to Shey, saying, “Shey, upon these colossals shalt thou makest light that they that proceed them may come forth.”\n",
    "And Shey rebuked Kin, saying, “Repent, sister, in your haste! We shall wait for a season. For behold, they which are to come are weak and shall require the nourishment of the colossals, and shall feast upon their flesh.  Therefore, we recess for a little while so that they may grow in the shadow.”\n",
    "And it came to pass that Kin and Shey waited for a season for the colossals to walk upon their place that they may grow in the shadow.\n",
    "And it came to pass that the colossals grew in the shadow, and their wandering had prepared the land for the light.\n",
    "[Scholars speculate that the point of the colossals was to develop an atmosphere that would shield the planets from the harmful radiation from the suns’ light.]\n",
    "And it came to pass that Kin again spoke to Shey, saying a second time, “Now we have waited a little while.  Shey, upon these colossals shalt thou makest light that they that proceed them may come forth.” \n",
    "And Shey cast forth her life-light and upon the colossals she made light.\n",
    "And the colossals saw the light, and it dried them up and they did begin in a great fall and in a great death.\n",
    "And thus began the end of the colossals.\n",
    "Chapter 3\n",
    "Hearken unto the words of the prophets, for in them we find the mercy and patience of the Sisters of life-light.\n",
    "And Shey is pleased with your acknowledgement of her patience, and Kin is pleased with your acknowledgement of her mercy.\n",
    "And have the prophets recorded these words, so as to be a remembrance of that which was done for the sake of all those under the suns.\n",
    "And it came to pass that those colossals which did fall, whose fall thereof was great and caused a great death upon its place.\n",
    "And which death has never before been witnessed because of the shadow which held up the colossals lest they would fall into death.\n",
    "And to death did they fall because of the light cast by Shey’s life-light.\n",
    "And from the fall, the colossals ruptured asunder.\n",
    "And though the skin of the colossals be as rock, the flesh of the colossals be as clay.\n",
    "Lo, the clay was soft and wet, and the shadow of the colossals retained the moisture of the clay and protected the clay from the light granted of Shey’s life-light.\n",
    "And lo, in the midst of the clay formed from the heart of the colossal a shard, and the shard radiated life-light, and the shard gave off Kin’s cold light.\n",
    "[This is the reason why scholars speculate it is Kin that is life.  Since Kin is blue, and the shards are blue, and the shards gave life to the ancients, so it must be that Kin’s life-light is that of life, and in turn Shey’s is that of light]\n",
    "Now the clay and the shard was as a nursery for the life granted of Kin’s life-light.\n",
    "And it came to pass that from the clay rose a garden, and the garden did contain many forms of habitation in the likeness of flowers, trees, insects, rodents, birds, and cattle.\n",
    "Thus was life sustained under the shadow by the clay and the shard.\n",
    "And thus was no life sustained away from the shadow because of Shey’s light, which did bring death to all that drifted from the shadow.\n",
    "And each garden was its own, separated by the casting of Shey’s light, which was shed forth betwixt them.\n",
    "And it came to pass that Kin spoke to Shey, saying, “O sister! I repent of my saying to thee to cast thy light upon these colossals that they that proceed them may come forth.  For behold, the way was not sufficiently prepared, and thy light doth bring death to all the inhabitants thereon, save they remain in the shadow of those that are fallen.”\n",
    "And Kin grieved deeply for the inhabitants under the sun, for this long while have they nurtured the calm and brought forth life only to have life spoil once they lookest upon it.\n",
    "And she grieved deeply for they that proceeded the colossals, for they were imagined to gaze upon the Sisters of life-light and worship.\n",
    "But behold, Kin and Shey saw no life, for in the moment that they lookest thereon, the life would spoil and die.\n",
    "And it came to pass that Shey sought to comfort Kin, saying, “Be thou comforted, little sister.  For behold, there are many a rocks whereon fall the colossals.  Verily, my light stretcheth not so strongly towards the further places.   Surely, such as these will find habitation under our light.”\n",
    "But Kin remained thus sorrowful, saying, “They that are not scorched by thy light wouldst not be blessed by my life, for my light doth not stretch so strongly as thine.”\n",
    "And Kin grieved more for the inhabitants under the sun.\n",
    "And Shey cast her eyes towards the settled rock shuddering under the magic weave but in vain.\n",
    "And it came to pass that she beheld Gyvth in the midst thereof, and spake saying, “Look!” And Kin beheld and looked.\n",
    "“There lies the ill-tempered Gyvth that was touched and from which we were birthed.  Behold, his anger doth cause tempests upon the land, which doth shield the inhabitants from my light.  He that was cursed with a sharded heart shall be the salvation of them that proceed the colossals: for he shall fall.\n",
    "And his fall shall bring forth clay and shard so that the inhabitants thereon might live.  And though the fallen colossals are separated upon his place, the inhabitants shall unite together under his flesh and shadow to worship us and live.  And behold, we shall look upon them for half the time with our light, which light we shall call day and which shadow we shall call night.  And the inhabitants will worship while day and rest while night.  And the light shall give us our joy and the shadow shall give them their life.”\n",
    "And Kin answered Shey, saying, “Behold, he doth not fall by thy light.”\n",
    "And Shey blessed the inhabitants of Gyvth, saying, “Upon Gyvth shall a thing we make that shall cause the fall of Gyvth so that he may die.  And that thing we make shall be called human, and human shall strike Gyvth so that he may die.”\n",
    "And Kin and Shey drew a portion of themselves and cast it upon Gyvth, bestowing the blessing of human habitation.\n",
    "[This is reference to Kin’la and Shey’la, the great deserts.  With “la” being interpreted as piece or portion of Kin and Shey.]\n",
    "Chapter 4\n",
    "O praise to ye, Kin and Shey, for your wisdom towards all those under the suns.  \n",
    "We thank ye, the Sisters of life-light, for your blessings.\n",
    "Glory and light and life to all the inhabitants of Gyvth because of your acceptance of our rock upon which ye bestowed our life with the grace of your blessings.\n",
    "Praise be to ye forever for sending a portion of your word and light and life to all the inhabitants of Gyvth.\n",
    "Hearken to the words, O inhabitants under the suns, and give heed to the counsels of the prophets.\n",
    "For behold, Kin and Shey placed a portion of themselves upon Gyvth, and lo, from the shadow of colossals sprung forth humankind.\n",
    "And Shey spoke unto Kin, saying, “Behold, here are humans that I have made, which thing together created we them. Human will strike Gyvth so that he may die, and human will worship us under the sun.\n",
    "For in human give we our nature to strike the earth, and to make as we make, and to become wise even in their moment of which we call life.\n",
    "Inasmuch as human has our portion, I will place impediment between the human and the magic weave, as to shake off temptation to become of gods like unto us.\n",
    "For we find joy in their worship and seek diligently for their casting of eyes towards us while under the suns.\n",
    "Therefore watch, little sister, and wait.  In humankind we shall find our redemption.”\n",
    "And it came to pass that Kin and Shey withdrew their presence, having placed a portion of their blessings upon Gyvth, and from the shadow of the colossals was raised humankind.\n",
    "And humankind knew not Kin and Shey for they were in shadow, and life-light was granted unto them by the colossal’s shard.\n",
    "Therefore, humankind knew not their makers, and thought their life to be but as it ought: knowing no purpose for existence.\n",
    "And behold, an account of human history from creation until the proceedings of prophets is given herein as accounted for by our ancestors.\n",
    "The first records of humankind\n",
    "Chapter 5\n",
    "I, Zerran, make a record of my people, it being the 41th warm cycle since the time of our counting.\n",
    "For we find it expedient to make a record of our history so that our descendents may know from whence they came.\n",
    "And I write these records in the script of my people, in which the order of the elders and the chieftain and his chief counselor do approve inasmuch as it is a break from tradition; nevertheless, we find it expedient to include it as tradition as if it were always so.\n",
    "For behold, we have great desire to preserve our traditions and language amongst our people for the profit and for the preservation of our souls as we pass onto the clay, which gave us life.\n",
    "And I, Zerran, the first chief record keeper of my people have been charged with transcribing all that is of import according to my people.\n",
    "And we call ourselves the keepers of the garden, for we tend to the flesh of our guardian, Ro’lim, who has offered his flesh unto us, he being the steward over my people to shield us from the tempests and burning light.\n",
    "For behold, we have lived in the cavity of Ro’lim for the duration of our lives, and remember no such time outside the protection of Ro’lim.\n",
    "And we know nothing about the lands outside of Ro’lim, save that which we see from within his protective womb.\n",
    "But we are grateful for Ro’lim’s care and do not consider much about the lands outside of Ro’lim, as it is forbidden of my people to indulge in such curiosity.\n",
    "For behold, the elders speak of those who have drifted outside of the womb of Ro’lim and were lost to the tempests and burning light, and whose souls were lost and whose bodies were lost and did not pass onto clay, but were scattered about as the dust of the wind.\n",
    "And we remember all those who indulge in such curiosity for our profit and preservation.\n",

    "We command the beasts by the herding into corrals where they may feed, and by the force of our tools that are used to hunt and kill the beasts so that they may pass onto the clay.\n",
    "And by our commands we sustain all life within Ro’lim, and our traditions are sufficient for our profit and preservation.\n",
    "Now, my people gather at the heart of Ro’lim, it being a great beacon that gives life and light to all within Ro’lim.\n",
    "Nevertheless it gives the greatest life and light near its base and thus we have built our cornucopia encircling the heart.\n",
    "And lo, it is forbidden to lay hands upon the heart, for behold the elders speak of a great purging that occurred many cycles ago.\n",
    "And a portion of the people, who indulged in the curiosity of fingering the heart, fell to a sickness wrought by the cursing of Ro’lim.\n",
    "For Ro’lim was displeased with the curiosity of his people, and shamed them with sickness of the skin, which sickness did break the soul as the inflicted bodies passed onto the clay.\n",
    "And such souls were lost forever; never to be birthed again from the clay.\n",
    "And never before had my people seen such a scourge, and the weeping and wailing for those that were lost was great and long.\n",

    "And we know these traditions to be righteous, yea even for our profit and preservation.\n",
    "And no such tradition is kept that would lead us to destruction.\n",
    "For behold, our elders speak concerning a portion of our people who have sought to alter the traditions, or ignore the counsel of the traditions for their gain.  Yea, even to indulge in curiosity and prosperity rather than to remain content in all things.\n",
    "And lo, the portion of our people who did follow false traditions were cursed, yea and in their cursing their souls were lost forever; never to be birthed again from the clay.\n",
    "Yea, and many of those false traditions did cause a sore death, and those who did not die we did cause to be put to death, so as to cleanse us of corruption.\n",
    "For it is better that a portion of the people to perish than it is for all to fall into false traditions and lose our souls.\n",
    "Therefore, hearken to the words of our traditions, and do keep them in all things and remember them always, and in them find profit and preservation.\n",

    "Upon the shoulders of the chieftain shall the tribe stand.\n",
    "And the chieftain is the mouthpiece of our traditions and the judge of Ro’lim, and he is justice and he is at no times mercy, for we give none unto those who disobey the traditions.\n",
    "And he shall guide the people, and part the people according to their functions.\n",
    "To some he makes farmers, to others he makes hunters, to others he makes breeders, and to others officers.\n",
    "And he shall appoint a chief record keeper, and a chief counselor, and a chief watchman, and a chief accountant.\n",

    "And he shall provide accounts to the chieftain at every warm cycle, numbering all things, and noting all things that are out of order.\n",
    "And at no time shall he allow for anything that has no place, for he shall not allow for prosperity, but shall strive for preservation in all things.\n",
    "And he shall be counseled by the elders every cold cycle according to the weightiness of his accounting.\n",
    "And shall be warned concerning a portion of the people who did allow for birthing which had not place and were found to practice false traditions and did perish.\n",
    "And did cause a curse to come upon the people, yea even a curse of degradation, even so much that Ro’lim could not sustain the increase and many did perish from want of food.\n",
    "And thus the chief accountant shall account righteously in all things, and be taught in all things by the elders.\n",

    "And at no time have we allowed for an exception to our traditions, or an altering of our traditions.\n",
    "Therefore, the traditions are pure and righteous in all things.\n",
    "And I, the chief record keeper, seal these traditions with my own hand, under the witness of the chieftain, the chief accountant, the chief counselor, and the order of the elders.  Amen.\n",

    "And it came to pass that a portion of the breeders rallied against the traditions and our teachings and did select with whom to breed as was pleasing unto them.\n",
    "And did arrange a manner of whoredom in which breeders did attempt to stay with a single breeding mate, yea even a breeding mate of their choosing.\n",
    "Yea, and this thing was most abominable in the sight of my people, and of the elders, and of the chieftain.\n",
    "And we did put to death all that did rally against the traditions written herein, for they did lose their souls in their sin.\n",
    "Yea, and there were many among the breeders put to death.\n",
    "And the elders did counsel new breeders, appointed by our chieftain under the recommendations of the chief accountant, yea even breeders who were young, and in their youth counseled unto the whoredoms hereto committed, and unto the traditions of my people, which are most pleasing unto Ro’lim and for our profit and preservation.\n",
    "And many cycles passed before we did recover from the loss, yea and truly our morning was great for that which we lost.\n",
    "And thus we see that false traditions lead to misery and sore trials among all the people, and thus we see that in the traditions we do preserve our people, yea our very souls we do preserve.\n",
    "And it came to pass that in the 232nd warm cycle since the time of our counting there were two of the people, yea even a breeder man and a breeder woman who did leave the protection of Ro’lim, and were as drifters amongst the tempests and the burning light, and we know not of their fate other than that their souls were lost to the dust of the tempests and they shall but surely perish by the harshness of the winds and the light.\n",
    "And it came to pass that after a short time, these two drifters did return again unto Ro’lim being weak with much hunger and bruised and burnt by the tempests and the burning light.\n",
    "And they did plead unto the chieftain for mercy to return again unto Ro’lim, notwithstanding the grievous sin they did commit, yea notwithstanding the curse of hunger and of skin and of bruised bones that was placed upon them.\n",
    "Yea, and the chieftain did speak to them, saying, “Wherefore, am not I the justice among the people, and canst justice not be fulfilled by mercy?”\n",
    "And after the manner of this speaking were the drifters condemned and put to death, yea by stone and tool were they put to death and their souls were lost forever; never to be birthed again from the clay.\n",
    "And their bodies were offered as sacrifice to Ro’lim, for never before have we borne witness to such sins since the time of counting, yea and never before have we grieved so deeply for the weakening of our obedience to the traditions.\n",
    "And my people watched more vigilantly from that time forth for signs and rumors of signs of disobedience and false teachings, for we greatly feared another disputation or act of rebellion.\n",
    "And the chief accountant did counsel with the chieftain and the chief counselor and the chief watchman, and the elders for an increase in watchman among the people, and his suggestion was approved by all who sat in counsel.\n",
    "And five new watchmen were appointed, to watch over the people and watch for signs and rumors of signs of disobedience and false teachings among the people.\n",

    "And it came to pass that in the 302nd warm cycle since the time of our counting, there was appointed a new chieftain of my people, for behold his predecessor had passed onto the clay mysteriously as he slept.\n",
    "And his body was examined and was found to be pierced at his heart, and his soul had found place to escape his body.\n",
    "Nevertheless, we know for a surety that his soul remains in Ro’lim and he shall be birthed again.\n",
    "For he was a righteous chieftain, exerting all energy in keeping to the traditions and being justice to the people.\n",
    "But behold, never before had we witnessed such a thing as his death.  For none have been put to death, save they had lost their souls to sin, since the time of our recording yea and since the remembering of the elders.\n",
    "And in this we do suspect murder, and such a sin has never before been accounted amongst my people.\n",
    "Yea and a deep fearful sadness has fallen upon my people, for we know not to whom cast blame, yea and we had no chieftain to be justice.\n",
    "And amongst my people walked a soulless, and my people feared the cursings of Ro’lim for allowing a soulless to walk amongst us unjudged.\n",
    "Therefore, the chief counselor did give suggestion for a new chieftain, which was swiftly agreed upon by the order of the elders, for they were fearful of having no chieftain to judge the people.\n",
    "And the new chieftain set about to examine all within the cornucopia, to find who was soulless, yea and who has committed such a grievous thing against my people, so that he may judge, and put to death that soulless one.\n",
    "Chapter 13\n",
    "I, Nevex, do continue the record of my people, it being the 304th warm cycle since the time of our counting.\n",
    "And it came to pass that in the 302nd warm cycle, Kla’ron, my predecessor, was found guilty by the judgement of our chieftain for being the soulless one who did pierce the heart of the chieftain, and did cause murder amongst my people.\n",
    "And a tool was found in his home with blood at its tip, yea the blood of the chieftain was at its tip, and he denied the tool, but we all saw and knew that he was soulless, for he was discovered in his sin.\n",
    "And it came to pass that the people did cast stones at him, and did beat him with their tools until he was dead, yea and his soul was lost forever: never to be birthed again.\n",
    "And his body was offered as sacrifice to Ro’lim, for never before have we borne witness to such sin since the time of counting.\n",
    "And the new chieftain was praised for his judgement, yea for he swiftly found the soulless amongst us, and my people did no longer fear, but did rejoice in his justice.\n",
    "And there was again peace amongst my people; nevertheless, I did struggle at heart knowing that my predecessor did perform such a grievous of sin.\n",
    "Yea, and I was to learn the script of my people, and the import of the records without his counsel and guidance.\n",
    "Yea, and though I had the elders to help in the script, this was a hard thing for me, and I did truly struggle in my role.\n",
    "Nevertheless, I knew Ro’lim did guide my hand, as I did quickly learn the script, so that I may write according to these things, so that they may be remembered by my people.\n",
    "Chapter 14\n",
    "Woe! Woe!\n",
    "Woe unto me! \n",
    "Woe unto my people!\n",
    "Woe unto all things under the protection of Ro’lim!\n",
    "For the vileness of our chieftain!\n",
    "For the sin that is upon his head, yea and the head of all those who do support him in his sin!\n",
    "May Ro’lim curse him: may he fall to sickness of skin, may he be discovered in his sin, may the stones be cast against him and against all those who do support him in his sin, yea that they may perish and their souls may be lost forever!\n",
    "He has altered the records, yea he has altered the very traditions written by the hand of Zerran of old.\n",
    "For behold, in the 304th warm cycle since the time of our counting, he did visit me in my youth, even in my ignorance did he visit me.\n",
    "And he did inquire of me concerning the script of my people.\n",
    "And he was clever with his words, yea and many did look upon our chieftain proudly for his cleverness in discovering the soulless in his sin.\n",
    "Yea, he did suggest to me that I was to teach him of the script, and in my foolishness, I did teach him.\n",
    "And in my pride I did teach him quickly, for I had myself learned quickly the script, and methought it my duty to teach the chieftain the script of my people.\n",
    "And I did not hearken to the records of Ki’azer, for he did truly write that only the chief record keeper and the elders are to know the script.\n",
    "For I was more dedicated to studying the script than to read the records for myself, and in my ignorance I knew not of his words.\n",
    "Yea, and I was not counseled by my predecessor concerning this thing, for he was put to death before I was to be appointed as a successor.\n",
    "And now I know in my heart that I did err, yet I do not believe in this thing I did lose my soul; nay, my soul was lost in a much greater sin.\n",
    "For behold, after I did teach the chieftain the script, he did inquire of me that he may study the records that I did keep.\n",
    "And I did show unto him where I did keep the records, and I did expound to him the traditions written by Zerran therein.\n",
    "And he did greatly rejoice in being read the records, and he did inquire of me if he could read, and I did permit.\n",
    "And he did read for himself the traditions written by Zerran of old, and he was exceedingly glad of it.\n",
    "And he did declare his gladness unto me, for I believed him to be a good chieftain and one to care deeply for his duties.\n",
    "Yea and I did suppose that he was glad to better understand his charge, for he, like me, was not taught by his predecessor, for he was murdered by my predecessor.\n",
    "And in this thing he did strive to guilt me, so that he may take the records to his own home to study them more.\n",
    "And in this I did fear to be contrary to the traditions, and I did suggest to him to inquire of the elders, for I feared in being false to the traditions.\n",
    "And he did promptly comply, and did thank me for being exact to the traditions and not wavering.\n",
    "And he did quickly leave to inquire of the elders, I supposed.\n",
    "And it came to pass that as I slept, he did creep into my house, and did take the records from me.\n",
    "And it came to pass that as I awoke, and did seek the records, I could not find them, for they were removed from their place of rest, and I knew in my heart that the chieftain had taken them.\n",
    "And in my anger, I did take haste to his home, and did not ask for entrance, but did intrude upon him in his secret place.\n",
    "Yea, and I did find him there, with the chief counselor, altering the records, yea the very portion that was written by the hand of Zerran of old.\n",
    "And in my haste, I did seize the records, and did flee from his home.\n",
    "Yea, and I did flee to the tent of the elders, to account to them all that I had seen and heard.\n",
    "Yea, that the chieftain had sinned against the traditions, and had taken the records, and had altered the traditions therein, and in this he had surely lost his soul!\n",
    "But behold, the chieftain did cry out to the people as I ran, saying, “this man has attempted to slay me in my home! Take him!”\n",
    "And there arose a great many of the people that did stand betwixt me and the elders, and they did hold tools and stones, and were ready to attack.\n",
    "For they trusted in the words of their chieftain, and in the moment were prone to irrational and unjust suggestions.\n",
    "And I began to be surrounded by the people, and they did chase after me, and did shout at me, and did accuse me, and did cast stones my way.\n",
    "And I was sore afraid, for I knew that I would perish before reaching the elders, and methought I was to fall victim to murder by the crowd.\n",
    "Nevertheless, I did flee for my life, and I did flee away from the cornucopia, and I did flee into the cavity of Ro’lim.\n",
    "And I did know the cavity well, for my father was charged as a hunter after my birth, and I did go with him oft into the cavity to help hunt.\n",
    "And I did fly with much haste being strong of leg, and being granted swift feet by the blessings of Ro’lim for my protection.\n",
    "Nevertheless, the crowd did press upon me, and did give me chase.\n",
    "And I knew that the crowd would soon be upon me, and I could find no place to hide myself.\n",
    "Therefore, I headed to the outer skin of Ro’lim, yea even in my haste did I travel towards that place which was not protected under the shadow of our guardian.\n",
    "And I knew that I could not survive the tempests and the burning light to which I fled, but I knew I could not face the crowd and live.\n",
    "And I did leave Ro’lim, which was forbidden, and lo, the people did not continue their pursuit, less they did that which would cause them to lose their souls.\n",
    "And they did know that I would perish, and that my soul would be lost forever: never to be birthed again.\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is better that I perish than it is for all to fall into false traditions and lose our souls. \n",
    "For behold, I remembered the records, which I held, and I knew that I must depart into the wastelands, and become as a drifter, and lose my soul.\n",
    "For the records need be protected from the chieftain and his cunning ways.\n",
    "And for this purpose do I take the records with me to the lands outside of Ro’lim, knowing that I shall perish by the tempests and by the burning light, but I do retain the traditions and history of my people.\n",
    "That perhaps my people may see the falsehoods of their chieftain, and repent of him, and hearken to the traditions as told by the elders.\n",
    "That a new record be made, like unto these records, save they be better protected from falsehoods and false leaders.\n",
    "For behold, this is the desire of my heart, but I know that my desire cannot save my soul from the tempests and the burning light.\n",
    "I have left my steward, and Ro’lim can no longer birth me from his clay, I am but as a drifter and shall perish in the light.\n",
    "And it came to pass that I did travel amid a tempest, yet the light was not so burning being as it was the cold cycle, but behold, I did see through the dust of the tempest a disk of light that radiated as to the heart of Ro’lim.\n",
    "Nevertheless, the brightness and heat from this light did far exceed that of the light from Ro’lim inasmuch as it did blind and burn.\n",
    "And the tempest did beat upon me, and I did feel the cutting of the wind and the dust and my eyes did burn and I did wander blindly.\n",
    "But by the blessing of Ro’lim, or the blessings of whichever god did rule over the wastelands, I did find a crevasse amidst the rocky lands, and I did hide myself amongst the rock from the winds and the dust.\n",
    "And I did cry mightily for all that was done, and did shake terribly, and found no solace in my escape from the storm.\n",
    "But behold, I did find sleep, and I did rest from my trials, and did wake to write these things upon the records.\n",
    "And I did strive to correct that part of the record that was altered, but behold, I knew not sufficiently the traditions to make correct these errors.\n",
    "And I did fear to write that which was false among the traditions, so I did remove that part that was altered, and pray to Ro’lim, or the god of this land, that any who find this record may know better of the traditions than myself, for I was still in my youth.\n",
    "And I write urgently to finish this record before my time is spent, so that I may close with my testimony that I am a just man, and a righteous man, save in this one thing did I sin, and I am cursed for my people’s sake, and in my cursing I shall surely die.\n",

    "But the words of the prophets do strive to guide ye unto the life-light that ye may be purified and worthy of the life-light.\n",
    "That ye may know from whence comest your salvation, yea and from whence comest your primogenitors.\n",
    "For Kin in her mercy doth preserve these records of the ancient inhabitants so we may examine their dealings with all those under the suns.\n",
    "Yea, so the prophets may have translated these ancient records and have interpreted them as to comprehend their purpose and meaning.\n",
    "Yea, and it is by the mercy of Kin that these records have been preserved this long while, and that we hath found them preserved this long while.\n",
    "Blessed be the prophets, for we have discovered these records in their purity and preservation.\n",
    "And blessed be they that are righteous, for they shall read these words and knoweth that the words be true.\n",
    "And can any inhabitant under the suns deny the godliness of Kin and Shey? Nay, he cannot.  For behold, the records of our primogenitors do speak of Kin and Shey, yea and even doth the truly blessed speak with Kin and Shey, and they are numbered among that of the prophets.\n",
    "And we know that Nevex did speak with Kin, for the dealings with Kin did he transcribe upon his records.\n",
    "And these records did we find and preserve for the profit of all inhabitants that shall live under the suns.\n",
    "And it came to pass that Kin did most steadfastly look unto Gyvth for a thing to stir and shake Gyvth as to strike him so that he may die.\n",
    "And for many seasons now Kin had waited for a thing to appear that Kin and Shey did make with the portion of themselves that was cast upon Gyvth.\n",
    "But behold, for this long time did Kin wait in vain.  For Gyvth continued in his anger, and the storms did cause the human things to hide within the colossals.\n",
    "Yea, and none did wander upon the lands, save those colossals that had not yet fallen from the life-light of Shey.\n",
    "And it came to pass that while it was yet in a cold season, Kin did look upon Gyvth for a thing to stir.\n",
    "And she beheld Nevex wandering in the tempests, and behold he did look upon Kin and beheld her life-light.\n",
    "And she did desire greatly for his worship unto her and her sister.\n",
    "And as she looked upon Nevex, she saw that he was without nourishment and was bruised by the tempests and the winds.\n",
    "And she did perceive that he was to perish, and she did about cry out to Shey and grieve greatly for this cause.\n",
    "And Kin did have exceeding passion towards Nevex for she did desire that he may worship and look upon his creators.  For behold, the moment that he did look upon her was glorious to her and she did cherish it.\n",
    "And it came to pass that she did about speak unto Shey, but Shey did not see the thing.\n",
    "For behold, Kin had stood betwixt Shey and the thing, and Shey was unable to look thereon.\n",
    "And behold, Kin was tempted in her heart, for she did desire to extend mercy unto Nevex, yet such a thing would surely be counseled against by her sister.\n",
    "For Shey was patient in her waiting, and did have faith in the thing that they did make.\n",
    "But Kin did not believe the thing was yet strong to the strength to strike Gyvth save he be granted mercy and power.\n",
    "Therefore, whilst Shey was blind to this moment, Kin did draw a portion of herself upon Gyvth and did visit Nevex, and did remove that impediment betwixt Nevex and the magic-weave.  \n",
    "Yea, and in her impatience and compassion did Kin work against the counsel of her sister.\n",
    "But behold, blessed be Kin, for if it were not so, we would cease to be.  And all the inhabitants upon Gyvth would have surely fallen to the tempests and winds.\n",
    "And surely Nevex could not have struck Gyvth without the power granted unto him by Kin.\n",
    "Therefore, we are grateful unto Kin for her mercy, and we are grateful unto Shey for her patience.\n",

    "And I did look and beheld a gargantuan beast.\n",
    "Yea, it was set to wander across the tempest wastelands, and its wandering was steady and its movement was slow.\n",
    "Nevertheless, as the beast’s foot found the firm ground, it did quake the earth.\n",
    "And it did bellow forth a mighty cry that did send forth the dust and the winds.\n",
    "And its flesh was as rock, and its body as a lumbering beast.\n",
    "And methought it to be a guardian, like unto Ro’lim, save it be not so large,\n",
    "For Ro’lim did sustain much life,\n",
    "Yea, in his resting flesh did he guard over the beasts, the plants, and the people.\n",
    "And his flesh was sufficient for the profit and preservation of my people for many generations.\n",
    "But this wandering guardian that stood not afar from me could not sustain my people, it being insufficient large for a body of people, and it being not of rest, but quaking of the ground.\n",
    "But behold, I did consider upon my state here in the crevasse and did consider that such a guardian could sustain myself for a time, if I were to but enter into the mercy of its flesh.\n",
    "Therefore, I did cry out in mighty prayer and worship to that guardian, saying:\n",
    "“Oh ye fair and merciful guardian! I, a wretched and lonesome drifter, do beseech thee to lookest upon my state.\n",
    "Yea, lookest upon my infirmities from the wind and the dust and the light.\n",
    "For behold, I was betrayed by my wicked chieftain and his counsel.\n",
    "And I had fled from them in hopes to preserve the traditions of my people.\n",
    "Ye and I did flee from before my guardian, Ro’lim.\n",
    "And I do pray thee, O great guardian, that thy mercy may be extended unto one such as I.\n",
    "Inasmuch as I may enter into thy flesh, and be sustained.”\n",
    "And it came to pass that the beast let out another mighty bellow, and I knew not of its meaning.\n",
    "Nevertheless, I did take it as a sign of his acceptance into his flesh.\n",
    "And it came to pass that I did leave my place of safety amidst the rocks and I did chase after this guardian.\n",
    "Yea, and I did wander into the wasteland, and the wind and the dust and the light did beat upon me.\n",
    "But the wind was not so strong as to hurl me from my place, and the dust was not so vicious as to cut through my flesh, and the radiant light of the disk piercing the dust did blind and burn, but I did feel it also give me speed and vigor.\n",
    "And I did press after the guardian, as to fall upon it.\n",
    "But the earth was crooked, and jagged, and I did occasionally stumble.\n",
    "And my feet did bleed as I fell, and the palms of my hands were bruised by the rock.\n",
    "But as I did move, I did remember what my father taught me, and I knew from my youth how to move across the twisted flesh of Ro’lim.\n",
    "And I did perceive that the flesh of the earth was like unto the flesh of Ro’lim.\n",
    "Therefore, I did press forward with confidence and speed.\n",
    "And I did occasionally cry out to the guardian in my travels, pleading for its mercy.\n",
    "For it did continually lumber further from me, and my exertion was great to fall upon it.\n",
    "And my chest did labor for air, and was filled with dust.\n",
    "Yea, and my legs did shake from the effort.\n",
    "Yea, and I did thirst and hunger.\n",
    "And I was discouraged in my travels that I may not fall upon the guardian, and live.\n",
    "Therefore, I did cry after that god, that it may have mercy and turn to meet me.\n",
    "But behold, it did not turn to meet me, and it did lumber forth, steadily moving away from me.\n",
    "And it came to pass that my pace did slow from the exertion, and I did fear greatly that I would be forsaken by the guardian in this wasteland.\n",
    "For this reason, I did drop the records of my people.\n",
    "Yea, I did leave it on the wayside, as to free my hand and steady my movement upon the jagged earth.\n",
    "And in that moment, I did value my own life over the traditions of my people, and I did feel in my heart the abandonment of my traditions.\n",
    "That my need was no longer according to the traditions of my people.\n",
    "That my profit and preservation was not in accordance to that which was written in our traditions.\n",
    "Therefore, I did discard my traditions in favor of my own preservation.\n",
    "And behold, in that moment the beast did bellow, and the bellow did blow forth the dust and the wind.\n",
    "And my footing was unsure in my desperation and panic, and as the wind and dust struck me, I did fall from my place.\n",
    "Yea, and behold, I did fall into a crack of the earth.\n",
    "And when I struck the bottom of the pit, my legs did break, and I did cry out in mighty pain.\n",
    "And my cries did ring forth within the cave, but that guardian did not hear me.  Nay, no guardian, nor man, nor creature of clay or flesh didst hear me.\n",
    "And methought that I would now surely perish, and I did shut my eyes and embrace the dark and cold of my death. Knowing full well that I would perish, and that my soul would be lost forever: never to be birthed again.\n",
    "And it came to pass that in the moment that I did abandon my hope, lo, in my mind’s eye I did behold a light.\n",
    "And the light didst start as just a spark, but did grow brighter and brighter still until it did fill my vision.\n",
    "And I was blinded by the brightness thereof, even with my eyes yet shut.\n",
    "Nevertheless I did not fear the light.\n",
    "For it did pierce my very soul and did overwhelm me with incredible heat and life and light.\n",
    "And never before had I experienced such infinite power and I did prostrate myself in fear and worship.  For no guardian, nor man, nor creature of clay or flesh didst ever reveal such power to any of my people according to our knowledge and records.\n",
    "And in the moment that I did worship the light, I did hear words spoken as if from the deepness of the light, and the words did fill my being.\n",
    "And it came to pass that the light spake unto me, asking me my name and I did give it.\n",
    "Then the light calling me by name did speak glory unto me, saying:\n",
    "“Nevex, because thou art the first to look upon me and behold the life-light, yea because thou doth worship me now, blessed are ye.\n",
    "For behold, I am Kin.  I am the Sister of life-light and thou art my creation.”\n",
    "Chapter 17\n",
    "Hear ye the words of Nevex, for he truly did speak unto Kin.\n",
    "Yea, and Kin did speak unto him so that he may preserve the words of the Sister of life-light, and that Nevex may be the first prophet unto Kin and Shey.\n",
    "Yea, and these words are preserved for all the inhabitants under the suns.  So that we may know the true form of worship. And to know in whom we worship, even the everlasting suns.\n",
    "And it came to pass that Kin did recount to Nevex all things regarding the creation of Gyvth and the colossals, hereto known by Nevex as the guardians, and the thing that proceeds the colossals, yea even Nevex and his kind.\n",
    "And after Kin did rehearse all these things unto Nevex, she did forth continue to speak unto him saying:\n",
    "“Nevex, thou shalt worship thy creators all thy days, yea thou shalt worship the Sisters of life-light, even Kin and Shey.  And we shall look upon thee and thy kind from the heavens in the sky and shall know and be honored by thy worship.”\n",
    "Then, I Nevex, asked saying:\n",
    "“How shall me and my kind worship unto thee to give thee thy honor? What meanest thou to worship thee and thy sister?”\n",
    "And Kin did declare unto Nevex:\n",
    "“Inasmuch as thou wilt study the doctrine, ye our very words unto the prophets, and if thou wilt hearken to the words which we shall give unto the prophets, so shall thee and thy kind worship unto me and worship unto my sister.\n",
    "And the doctrine shall be given by the prophets in prophecies and revelations.  And the prophets will record these things for their kind and for their descendants.  That all inhabitants under us may know of our doctrine and worship accordingly.\n",
    "Therefore, Nevex, thou shalt be a prophet unto thy kind, and record these things so that they may be known unto the inhabitants upon Gyvth.  And I give unto thee these things inasmuch as thou art the first to give worship unto me and unto my Sister.\n",
    "And our doctrine is thus:\n",
    "Ye inhabitants under the suns, thy birthright is the power and investment to look upon the Sisters of life-light whilst ye doth sojourn in your material frames.\n",
    "Ye are born of the clay of the colossals and the spirit of the magic weave.  Yet these art not thy gods.\n",
    "For behold, thou shalt never worship a proportion of Kin nor Shey.\n",
    "Thou shalt worship us during the day and rest during the night.\n",
    "Thou shalt proclaim this doctrine to all the inhabitants under the suns.  For we desire all inhabitants to worship and look upon us.\n",
    "If thou shalt do all these things, in the day of eternal shadow, thy portion shall be received unto us and thou shalt be saved.\n",
    "For when clay shall dry and crumble and the magic weave tear asunder, thy worship shall be remembered unto us and we shall receive thee again into our eternal life-light.\n",
    "And the darkness will have not the strength to contend against the life-light.  And thy oppressors shall be burnt by the light, and the light wilt not receive them.\n",
    "And this is our doctrine, and as a testament unto thy kind and all things upon the face of Gyvth, we shall rise in the morning and set in the evening, and shall rise again the next day, and all days hereafter until the eternal darkness.\n",
    "When thy oppressors say, ‘we believe not in thy gods,’ thou shalt proclaim, ‘consider the suns how they rise and set upon us day-by-day.  Consider the life-light that they do extend unto us as we sojourn in their radiance.  Behold, did not Kin proclaim this as a sign of her divinity. What say ye?  Is this not truth?’\n",
    "And thy oppressors will not have the utterance to say against thee.  And their words will be like a fool who diggest his face into the sand.  For he doth blind himself to the truth.  And thou shalt know that he will be forgotten in the day of eternal shadow, and he shall be burnt and scourged all the days of his life.  And our life-light will be but a curse to him.\n",
    "For I am Kin, and I will heed the call of the inhabitants under the suns.  And I will extend my mercy unto thee and thy kind.  And thou shalt be blessed in the time of thy need.”\n",
    "And it came to pass that I, Nevex, did listen unto the words of Kin and did honor her words and truth and doctrine.  And I did desire to fulfill her words and be blessed.\n",
    "Therefore I did inquire of my god:\n",
    "“How shall I declare this doctrine unto my kind?\n",
    "For behold my legs are broken, and my body is bruised, and the winds and the tempests and thy light doth consume me and my people.\n",
    "For these reasons we remained guarded within Ro’lim and all that set forth to wander across the wastelands are as drifters.\n",
    "And behold, the wasteland hath not the heart of the guardian to sustain us.\n",
    "Therefore, to worship thee and thy Sister is to perish, and without our soul to be birthed again, we should not return to worship thee again for we shall lose our lives.”\n",
    "And it came to pass that Kin did answer me, saying:\n",
    "“I shall take away the enmity of Gyvth and he shall have no more power to bruise and to break and to tear asunder with his mighty winds.\n",
    "Behold, for this long while, Gyvth hath shielded his flesh from our light with his storms of sand and wind that Shey’s light might not cause him to fall like hereto the other colossals did fall.  And their fall thereof was great.  And terrible was the fall, for behold, there was not sufficient time betwixt their creation and fall to ensure the life of the things that proceed them.\n",
    "Yet Gyvth was ill tempered and selfishly cast himself from our life-light, so that he may not fall and that life may not be.\n",
    "Nevertheless in this thing he did prepare the way for all ye inhabitants under the suns to live and worship us.  For in his tempest ye hath not burned.  And the time of Gyvth’s fall is at hand.  For in the shadow of his flesh, ye shall not burn.\n",
    "But behold, Gyvth must fall for his flesh to sustain life, and if he doth not fall, all inhabitants will surely remain without worship unto us.\n",
    "Yet he doth not fall from Shey’s light because of his tempests, therefore he must fall from some other way.\n",
    "And lo, Nevex, thou art chosen to strike Gyvth at his heart.  And whenst thou doth strike Gyvth, behold, he shall hath no more power to bruise and to break and to tear asunder with his mighty winds.  And he shall be as a fallen collossal to thee, and his flesh shall sustain thee.  Yea, his flesh shall sustain all the inhabitants under the suns.\n",
    "Then, thee and thy people shall look up to see the suns and thou shalt worship us all the days of thy life.\n",
    "But for this cause thou must prepare thyself.\n",
    "And I grant unto thee a portion of my power to sufficiently  prepare thyself for that day whenst thou wilt strike down Gyvth.”\n",
    "Chapter 18\n",
    "And many more things did Kin reveal unto me, but commanded that I would not to record them at this time; nevertheless, I was to reveal them according to the needs and experiences of the inhabitants that worship worthily.\n",
    "And when Kin did finish her sayings, she did rejoice in her doctrine and did shine forth.\n",
    "And her being did overtake me and I was filled with her radiance and life and light.\n",
    "And I became fatigued and did find rest, and I did sleep for some time, having been watched over by Kin and her light.\n",
    "Now when I did awaken from my slumber, I did behold that I was no more encircled about by the light of Kin and that I was alone in the crevasse of the earth.\n",
    "Nevertheless, I did find that embedded within my chest was a shard, and the shard was like unto the heart of Ro’lim save it was small like unto my hand, yet the shard did warm me and did provide me with energy.  That I may be shielded like unto the protection of my guardian, yet this shield would remain with me as I did wander to and fro.\n",
    "Moreover, I knew it to be a gift from Kin, as to give me the strength to save myself from being lost and to die in this pit.\n",
    "And it came to pass that as I stood to walk, I was surprised to discover that my leg was healed and that my bruises were healed and that I was whole again.\n",
    "And for this cause did I give thanks unto Kin for her mercy and compassion for my welfare, yea even for my profit and preservation.\n",
    "Therefore, I was determined to leave this pit.\n",
    "Thus I did climb against the wall of the pit and was diligent to find proper foot, for methought that if I should fall, I should surely impair myself again.\n",
    "But behold, the walls of the pit were high and the surface was slick, and as I reached not halfway up, I became exhausted and slid and fell to the bottom.\n",
    "And I did cry out in pain, for my body did bruise and was sore from the fall.\n",
    "And my limbs were too weak to move and too broken to stand, so I waited to die or for Kin to save me again.\n",
    "And it came to pass that as I did wait, the light beaming from out of the crevasse, that is the light of Kin and Shey, began to diminish.\n",
    "And darkness did replace the light, and I did recall Kin’s words that there was a time set aside of shadow.  And the shadow was to be called night.  And Kin did promise that there again would be her light to shine across the wastelands. And the light was to be called day.  And in reverence to the light the cycle of light and shadow was to be called a day.  And this was for a measurement so that the inhabitant under the suns may account for his worship all the days of his life.\n",
    "And I did also remember what Kin did speak unto me that I should rest during the night.  Therefore, I did choose this time to rest.\n",
    "And as I did rest, I did sleep, and when I did awake, lo, I did find that my body was cleansed again of its harm.\n",
    "And I knew that Kin had watched over me and restored me to my proper frame.\n",
    "And I did give thanks unto her and did mightily ask for her aid in leaving this earthy prison.\n",
    "And when I did feel that I had sufficiently called upon my god for aid, and that the shadow of night had passed into day, I did start again the ascent.\n",
    "Thus I did attempt to climb against the wall a second time, but was unable to escape its jaws.\n",
    "Yea, I did fall again into the shadowy mouth of this beast and was again tormented by the pain and the weakness of my limbs.\n",
    "I thought that perhaps I had done wrong and offended my new god in some way, for I understood not why she would not rescue me from the dark.  Yea, and never did I suppose that she would that I learn for myself of the power that she did leave with me.  In my frustration and anger, I did not understand that I was required to find a new way.\n",
    "And I did consider to curse Kin for her trickery in giving me hope and yet leaving me to die.\n",
    "But I did hold my tongue, and I am grateful indeed for the least portion of patience that I did possess.  For had I allowed my troubles to overtake me, I fear that Kin would have truly abandoned me notwithstanding that I know now that she stood not far off to watch and wait.\n",
    "And never again will I consider to curse my gods.  Yea, Kin is merciful unto all the inhabitants under the suns, and her mercy is as consistent and everlasting as her face, which doth rise in the morn.  Yea, and Shey is patient towards all the inhabitants under the suns, that she understandeth our sorrows and afflictions and longsufferings and she waiteth for us to rise and worship by our own desire according to the intents of our heart, and her patience is as consistent and everlasting as her face, which doth rise with Kin.\n",
    "Nevertheless, in this moment, I was much grieved and confused, and my mind and body were fatigued.  Therefore, I do only consider upon the mercy and patience of my gods retrospectively, for in that moment, I did consider no such thing.\n",
    "And as I did rest again, my body did receive its strength, and I did again attempt the ascent, but did find no success.\n",
    "And I did no more attempt to ascend the walls, for the task was impossible and my hope had diminished.\n",
    "And I did lie prostrate on the ground until my body was healed again, yet I did not rise.\n",
    "To rise and face the wall again was beyond my willpower to bear.\n",
    "So I did lay and wait for death to overtake me, for I knew not another way out.\n",
    "And I did meditate on all the things that I did see and hear and I did wonder about the shard swallowed by my chest.\n",
    "And as I did lay against the ground, my mind did drift, and my thoughts were as twisted and thrown about as the tempests of the wasteland.\n",
    "As I was carried away in my thoughts, my mind became even more deviant and my vision became blurred and so irregular methought I had entered a dream.\n",
    "But I had not dreamed, nay, rather my eyes were opened and I began to see that which was unseen.\n",
    "There about me was an entanglement of shadowy threads, and the threads did bind together in an elaborate weave.\n",
    "And the weave was bound to me and to the rock and to the wasteland tempests above me, and to the air and to the sand at my feet, and to my very soul, yea to all things was the weave connected.\n",
    "And as I did begin to see the weave, I was shaken, and did close my eyes as to assume that when they would open again, the dream would be gone.\n",
    "But the weave did extend into the darkness of my shut eyes, and I did still see it, and I did open my eyes, and I did still see it.\n",
    "For the weave is not seen by vision, but is seen of the mind, and I know not how to shut my mind of it, nor do I anymore wish to hide myself from it, for behold, it is the magic weave that doth give life to spirit and shard and clay and earth.\n",
    "And only I, Nevex, am to see it.  For I have been touched by Kin, and she did give me a portion of her power so that I may know how to manipulate the weave in my favor, according to the will of Kin, who hath granted its manifestation unto me.\n",
    "And it came to pass that whilst I was yet in the pit, I knew not the meaning of the weave and I was perturbed to wonder what was its significance.\n",
    "Therefore, I did reach out my hand but to touch it, yet as I moved the weave did shutter and was contorted by the movement thereof.\n",
    "But the contortion was strange unto me.  For the weave did bend and tug in a manner unexpected.\n",
    "Nevertheless, I did stand and attempt to manipulate the weave.\n",
    "Yea, I was entranced by its beauty and complexity, and for much time did I freely distract myself with the weave.\n",
    "And I was so enthralled by my new knowledge that I know not how long I was thus occupied.  Be it but a moment, or days, or seasons, I know not.\n",
    "For I had lost care for nourishment, and for rest, and for sleep.  Yea, I had lost worry of death and of pain and of being cast out of my guardian.  Nevertheless, I did still greatly desire to leave this pit so that I might see the weave span across the wasteland.\n",
    "Therefore, in my studying of the weave, I did learn how to contort and gesture my body as to pull at a desired thread in the weave.\n",
    "And as I did pull at the weave, the sand and the air did move accordingly.\n",
    "And as I did better perfect my somatics, I was able to pull more firmly on the weave, and the rock and earth did move accordingly.\n",
    "And it came to pass that I decided to leave the pit, and I did pull at the wall, and the wall did shift, and from the wall was formed a step, and I did pull again, and hence was formed another step.  And I did continue until there were steps sufficient for me to walk out from my prison, and I did leave the pit.\n",
    "Chapter 19\n",
    "Now it came to pass that once I did walk from the pit, I was once again greeted by the wind and the tempests and the sands in the whirlwinds did beat upon me.\n",
    "And I did attempt to control the weave to shield myself from the storm, but the weave was being whipped and contorted about by the winds and the tempests and the whirlwinds.\n",
    "Yea, the chaos was impossible to bring to order, and I was hardly able to keep my thoughts clear from the tangling and thrashing and entropy of the weave.\n",
    "But I could not let go of the disorder, for I could not escape the presence of the weave within my mind’s eye.\n",
    "Therefore, I did press forward through the tempest, not knowing but whereto I wandered, but knowing that I must press forward or perish.\n",
    "Nonetheless, I did look up into the wind and dust, and behold I did observe the disk of light in the sky that I knew to be Kin.\n",
    "Yea, and I did behold that adjacent to Kin was another disk of light that I knew to be her sister, Shey.\n",
    "Thus these were the Sisters of Life-light, my gods, and I and my people, and all inhabitants under the suns were to worship them all the days of our lives.\n",
    "And I did clearly discern the meaning of Kin when she said that Gyvth was ill tempered, for I was beaten by his winds, and I did clearly discern the meaning of Kin when she said that Gyvth hath shielded his flesh from the Life-light, for the disks of light were mostly overshadowed by the dust.\n",
    "And I did remember Kin’s promise that if I were to strike Gyvth that he shall hath no more power to bruise and to break and to tear asunder with his mighty winds.  And he shall be as a guardian, and his flesh shall sustain all the inhabitants under the suns.\n",
    "Therefore, as he did beat upon me with his winds and dust and tempests, I did press forward knowing that I must stay determined to strike at his heart if I were to save me and my people from his anger.\n",
    "Now, I did follow after the disks of light, and did believe them to guide me to the heart of Gyvth that I may strike it.\n",
    "Thus I did begin to wander in the direction of the disks of light in the sky, yea even following the light of Kin and Shey.\n",
    "And it came to pass that I did travel across the cliffs and rocks and sand, and Gyvth did beat upon me all the day.\n",
    "And as Kin and Shey sunk into the flesh of Gyvth and darkness did begin to overshadow the wastelands, I did find a place to prepare myself for rest.  For the night did come and Kin and Shey had hidden themselves from me to no longer guide my path.\n",
    "Therefore, I did hide myself in a crack in the rocks and did sleep.\n",
    "And it came to pass that when I did awake, it was yet again day, and my bruises and cuts and burns from drifting in the wastelands were healed, and I did thank Kin for her preservation.\n",
    "And it came to pass that I did begin to wander again across the face of Gyvth, knowing that I was being guided by my gods.\n",
    "And the wandering did inflict heavily upon me, yea even with bruising and bleeding and burning.\n",
    "And as the night came I did again find rest, and when the suns rose, I was again healed.\n",
    "Yea, I did wander this way for many days.\n",
    "But behold, there was no indication that I was on the right path to fulfill Kin’s wishes.  For she did not again speak unto me, nor prompt me of the direction that I did take.\n",
    "And I began to be discouraged in my efforts, with no indication of my progress, and for one day I did not travel but I did rest and ponder.  Thus I did more fully try to discern my direction in the wastelands.\n",
    "And as the suns did arise from Gyvth, and did rise up into the sky, and did fall into Gyvth again, I did notice that the path was curved, and that the suns did arise and set on different sides of Gyvth.\n",
    "Thus I did consider myself foolish and said to myself, “Yea, I am but a fool!  As I have been following towards the light of Kin and Shey my path has not been straight, but has been sinuous and has been but to the left and to the right yet not forward as I would have supposed.”\n",
    "And I did consider upon why my gods would misdirect my wandering such that I could make no progress forward.  But it was not my gods that hath misdirected me.  Nay, it was I, Nevex, who did but assume that the path of Kin and Shey was the path that I should take.\n",
    "Nevertheless, my path was not to approach my gods, but to strike at Gyvth.\n",
    "Yea, and I did now understand that the ways of the gods are not meant to be our ways.  That all the inhabitants under the suns were not to follow the ways of our gods, but we were instead to follow the words of our gods.  For if we are to follow their commandments, our path shall be made known.  And their words guideth us to worship our gods, which is enough to save our portion unto Kin and Shey in the day of eternal shadow.\n",
    "Therefore, I did consider upon another way to find direction through the wastelands.  Yea, I did consider upon the possible signs that could guide my path.\n",
    "I did consider the landmarks and features of the wasteland to guide me, but the dust was strong and did oft obstruct my view and the I could not see sufficiently far enough off to be guided by the features of Gyvth.\n",
    "I did consider the movement of the tempests, supposing I could follow the winds, but the wind did toss to and fro having no direction.\n",
    "I did consider the shadows cast across the wasteland from the large cliffs and rocks, but the shadows did continually hide from the light of Kin and Shey and did therefore move like unto the disks.\n",
    "And for many days I did try many paths and ways of direction, but did find all to be insufficient.\n",
    "And I did consider again upon the path of Kin and Shey, for their path was but the only constant amongst the tempests.\n",
    "And I did consider the curve, as it did favor the same part of the sky.\n",
    "And I did consider the part within the curve that was favored, and did see that the part was constant.\n",
    "And I did set my path to be the point halfway betwixt the rising and setting of the suns.\n",
    "And I did test the path by traveling several days, following that point upon the horizon.\n",
    "And it came to pass that though the face of Gyvth did change and did cause my path to be indirect, and that though Kin and Shey would rise and set, I did find this path to be sufficient to keep me on my course.\n",
    "Nevertheless, I knew not to where I wandered, and I had not direction from Kin as to which way was the heart of Gyvth.\n",
    "And I did often worry whether I be on the inside or outside of Gyvth and whether I should wander in the wasteland, or descend into a deep crevasse, hoping to find but an way inside his flesh if I were but on the outside.\n",
    "Even I did suppose that I would never fulfill the desires of my god, as I had wandered many days, even on my straight course, without any sign, or guidance, or sight of his heart.\n",

    "Society below the ground rarely comes up to the guardian unless to trade or if they are sick.  They have been mutated without the guardian heart and are more degenerated and miserable.  They are gluttonous and horde piles of gems mined from the caverns.  They are covered in riches, but unhappy and dying, but refuse to leave the mine.  They compete with each other for wealth.  And many are found dead buried within their own chambers, not dare leaving for food as the people down here tend to steal from each other.  Very little cooperation.  Rare to have families, and children typically have defects.  Parents don’t care for children so they either learn to survive on their own or most often die.  Instead, those from the guardian who feel it better to leave the safety often find their way into the mines: as those in the mines die, it’s more wealth for those who take their place.\n",

    "Outer guardian does farm labor and is crippled by inner guardian.  They have tried to find another way into the inner guardian, but the skin is too thick.  They want to upset the balance so that there aren’t two societies.\n",
    "Nevex decides to break through the guardian flesh while the inner people sleep so that the outer people can surprise them in their sleep, threaten them to back down, take the weapons, and ensure a balance.  Instead, the outer people take the weapons, slaughter the inner people in their sleep and drive them to the outer guardian.  They simply flip the power on its head and do exactly what the inner people did, then they just have to guard two openings into the inner guardian.  Nevex is so disgusted, he leaves without trying to fix it any more.\n",

    "Only a few people remain.  They can barely talk and are uncivilized.  There is cannibalism and odd sacrifices and rituals.  The people cut, prick, and mutilate themselves.  There is disease, rape, and no cultivation of food.  Nevex does not stay long.  He destroys the guardian and all that remain in it to end their suffering.\n",
    "Guardian in which all people can read and work together to determine marriage and jobs.  No punishment of death.\n",
    "People are happy, and everyone has an important role that they actually like.\n",
