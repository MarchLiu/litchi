    " It's a fruit that is sweet, juicy and tangy all at the same time. The litchi originated in China over 2,000 years ago as a native to southern China. Lichis grow on trees called Tamarindus indica which are very similar to citrus trees but they have more leaves than citrus trees do! They can reach heights of up to sixty feet tall! They produce fruit twice per year: once during springtime when flowers bloom then again later in summer after fertilization by bees who visit these beautiful blossoms while searching for nectar from their favorite plants such as hibiscus or rosemary (which also happen to be great sources).\n",
    "## A Magic Furit \n",
    "A magic furit is a fruit that can be used to make you feel better when you are sick. It has healing powers, so it will help your body get well faster than normal foods do not have these benefits because they don't contain any nutrients or vitamins at all! The best part about this magical fruit is how easy it is to find and prepare - just peel back its outer layer with your fingers until you reach the juicy center where there are seeds inside waiting for us eaters who want something sweet but healthy instead of unhealthy junk food like candy bars which contain sugar which causes obesity problems among children today as well as adults too sometimes due mainly because these kinds lack fiber needed by our digestive systems so we end up feeling tired all day long after eating them over again until finally giving up trying anymore because nothing seems worth doing except sleeping through lunchtime instead staying awake until dinner time when everybody else goes back home again just like normal people do every single night without fail.\"\n",
    "## A Magic Furit \n",
    "A magic furit is a fruit that can be eaten by anyone and everyone. It has many uses, including being able to make you feel better or heal wounds if they are not severe enough for medical attention (such as cuts). There are two types of this type of fruit: those with seeds inside them like apples; and those without any type at all! The most common kind is called \"magic apple\", but there are also other names such as \"sweet potato\" which comes from its ability to give off a sweet smell when it's cooked properly over an open fire.\""
